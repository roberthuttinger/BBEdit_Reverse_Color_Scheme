BBEdit_Reverse_Color_Scheme
===========================

If you reverse the screen colors on your monitor on long days of coding it is much easier on the eyes. This is a representation of the default settings of the colors in BBEdit reversed and tweaked slightly for optimization.

Copy and create the file `Reverse_Colors.bbcolors` to location

`~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Color Schemes`

If this location does not exist create it, restart BBEdit, then drop this file in the directory.

To initialize the color file, `open preferences > text colors` at the top of the right column there is a drop down, select `Reverse_Colors`

You may want to make minor adjustments for you lighting conditions, monitor settings etc.
